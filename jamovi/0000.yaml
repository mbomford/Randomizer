description: >-
  Randomize balanced single factor or full factorial experiments using
  Completely Randomized, Randomized Complete Block, or Latin Square designs.
  Generate plot maps, plot lists, and design property tables. Restore a
  particular randomization using its unique ID. Prepare for randomization by
  making each factor name a column header in jamovi's spreadsheet, with levels
  of that factor listed below.
